			You can use UCFileSpace to publish web pages or share files on the Internet from a folder on your hard disk.
			<BR><BR>
			
			Here&#146;s how it works: Create your website by changing this page (it's called "index.html" and 
			it's in the Sites folder in your home folder on UCFileSpace) and creating any other HTML pages you want.
			<BR><BR>
			
			Your website is located at http://homepages.uc.edu/~username .  Just replace 'username' with your
			UC user ID &#151; the same one you use to login to UCFileSpace, UCit's computer labs, Bearcat Online email, etc.
			<BR><BR>
			
			That&#146;s it. You&#146;re done &#151; your page is ready for viewing.

			<B>HTML, anyone?</B>
			<BR><BR>
			
			HTML is easy &#151; so easy that even a first-time user can do it. That's because you don&#146;t have to learn HTML to use it. 
			<BR><BR>

			Leading word processing applications, such as Microsoft Word and AppleWorks 6, actually generate HTML webpages for you 
			with just a few clicks of a mouse.
			<BR><BR>

			HTML &#151; short for hypertext markup language &#151; is what webmasters and designers use 
			to publish text and graphics on the Internet in a form that can be read by any web browser.
			<BR><BR>
			
			To create an HTML webpage in Microsoft Word, all you have to do is choose Save as HTML from the File menu. 
			Word will save your work as an HTML page, ready for publishing on the Internet.
			<BR><BR>

			In AppleWorks 6, choose Save As from the File menu, then choose HTML from the pop-up menu. Next, just type in the name 
			you want to save the page with and click the Save button, and it&#146;s like boom &#151; instant HTML.

			1. Create the HTML pages for your website and put them in the Sites folder in your home folder on UCFileSpace.
			<BR><BR>

			Substitute your own content for the text, graphics, and links in this page (index.html)
			to create a customized welcome page. Create other HTML pages following your application's instructions 
			for linking pages and graphics.
			<BR><BR>
			
			2. Make sure you have a working network connection. If you need help, contact the UCit Help Desk or visit 
			the Walk-in Help Desk in the UCit Student Technology Resources Center, located in 630 Steger Student Life Center.
			<BR><BR>
			
			4. Note the address for your website:<br>
			<blockquote>http://homepages.uc.edu/~username</blockquote><br>
			where 'username' is your UC user ID &#151; the same one you use to login to UCFileSpace, UCit's computer labs, Bearcat Online email, etc.
			<BR><BR>

			Give this address to the people you want to access your web site. They can connect to your web site and view your published 
			documents by typing this address in their web browser.
